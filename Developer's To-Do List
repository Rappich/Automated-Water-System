# Developer's To-Do List

## Hardware

* [ ] Acquire all necessary components.
* [ ] Build the circuit on a breadboard.
* [ ] Test each component individually.
* [ ] Integrate all components into the complete circuit.
* [ ] (Optional) Design and 3D print an enclosure.
* [ ] Integrate a Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HM-10) for communication with the app.

## Software (Arduino)

* [ ] Write Arduino code for reading soil moisture sensor.
* [ ] Write Arduino code for reading light sensor.
* [ ] Write Arduino code for controlling the water pump.
* [ ] Write Arduino code for controlling the UV LED.
* [ ] Implement logic for automatic watering and UV light control.
* [ ] Implement LED indicator for pump status.
* [ ] Implement OLED display functionality.
* [ ] (Optional) Implement RTC module functionality.
* [ ] Implement Bluetooth communication to send sensor data to the app.
* [ ] Test sensor readings and control logic.
* [ ] Calibrate sensors and adjust thresholds.
* [ ] Optimize code for efficiency.
* [ ] Document the code.

## Mobile Application Development

* [ ] Choose a mobile app development platform (e.g., React Native, Flutter, native Android/iOS).
* [ ] Design the app's user interface (UI).
* [ ] Implement Bluetooth communication in the app to receive sensor data.
* [ ] Display soil moisture and light level readings in the app.
* [ ] Implement a real-time graph for sensor data.
* [ ] Implement notifications for low soil moisture or low light levels.
* [ ] Implement history logging of sensor data.
* [ ] Test the app on different devices.
* [ ] Optimize the app for performance.
* [ ] Document the app's code.

## Testing

* [ ] Test the system in a controlled environment.
* [ ] Test the system with different types of plants.
* [ ] Monitor the system for reliability over time.
* [ ] Test the Bluetooth communication and app functionality.
* [ ] Document test results.

## Documentation

* [x] Create README.md.
* [x] Create SRS.md.
* [x] Create TODO.md.
* [ ] Create a schematic diagram of the circuit.
* [ ] Document the assembly process.
* [ ] Create a user manual.
* [ ] Create an app user guide.
