#  Developer's To-Do List

## Backlog
- [ ] (Optional) Implement RTC module functionality.  

##  To Do 
- [ ] Build the circuit on a breadboard.  
- [ ] Test each component individually.  
- [ ] Integrate all components into the complete circuit. 
- [ ] Test sensor readings and control logic.  
- [ ] Calibrate sensors and adjust thresholds.  
- [ ] Optimize code for efficiency.  
- [ ] Document the code.  
- [ ] Test the system in a controlled environment.   
- [ ] Monitor the system for reliability over night.  
- [ ] Document test results.  
- [ ] Create a schematic diagram of the circuit.  
- [ ] Document the assembly process.  
- [ ] Create a user manual.
