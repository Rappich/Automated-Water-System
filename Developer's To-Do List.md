# Developer's To-Do List

## Backlog
- [ ] (Optional) Implement RTC module functionality.  
  - *As a user, I want the system to track time so that scheduled watering can occur even if the Arduino is restarted and to ensure that the the system can be programed to handle different plants.*

## To Do

- [ ] Monitor the system for reliability overnight.  
  - *As a user, I want to see if the system functions reliably over an extended period without failures.*  

## In Progress
